NOTE: The content provided is based on the first semester in 2023. The content is subjected to change.

## Getting Started
- [ZIP] [Lab manual](https://github.com/krishsharma0413/muj-iot-lab/tree/main/files/allactivities.zip)
- [DOCX] [Activity 1-8 images combined](https://github.com/krishsharma0413/muj-iot-lab/tree/main/files/a1ta8img.docx)
- [PDF] [Activity 9 and 10 images combined](https://github.com/krishsharma0413/muj-iot-lab/tree/main/files/a9na10img.pdf)


### Prerequisites
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) - for physical arduino.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - for raspberry pi.
- [Wokwi Arduino Simulator](https://wokwi.com/arduino/new) - better than TinkerCAD imo.
